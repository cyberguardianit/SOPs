# SOP: Remote Support Methodology with ConnectWise (Incorporating CompTIA Troubleshooting Theory)

## Purpose: 
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the process for conducting remote support engagements using ConnectWise.

## Scope: 
This procedure applies to all IT technicians and support staff involved in providing remote support using ConnectWise.

### Responsibilities: 
- Implementation: IT Support Technicians
- Following: All IT technicians providing remote support
- Reviewing: IT Support Management
- Maintaining and Updating: IT Support Technicians

### Prerequisities
- ConnectWise user account with appropriate permissions.
- Valid user credentials for authentication.

### Procedure:
Overview: 
  This procedure focuses on the methodology for remote support engagements using ConnectWise, addressing how remote support will take place and the troubleshooting methodology technicians will follow.
1. Remote, Offsite Support Engagements:
Overview: Outline how remote support engagements will be conducted using ConnectWise.
  - Steps:
    - Log in to ConnectWise with valid user credentials.
    - Access the remote support section to initiate engagements.
2. Troubleshooting Methodology
Overview: Define the troubleshooting approach during remote support engagements incorporating the CompTIA Troubleshooting Theory.
  - Steps:
    - Gather information about the issue from the end user:
      - Communicate with the end user to understand the reported issue.
      - Ask questions aligned with the CompTIA Troubleshooting Theory to gather relevant information.
      - Document error messages, symptoms, and any recent changes to the system.
    - Establish a Theory of Probable Cause:
      - Analyze the information gathered and form a hypothesis about the root cause.
      - Consider the most likely causes based on the CompTIA Troubleshooting Theory.
    - Test the Theory to Determine the Cause:
      - Use remote access tools through ConnectWise to perform diagnostic tests.
      - Utilize testing tools and methodologies to narrow down potential causes.
      - Gather additional data to confirm or refute the initial theory.
    - Establish a Plan of Action to Resolve the Problem:
      - Based on the confirmed cause, create a plan to resolve the issue.
      - Consider the most efficient and effective solutions, taking into account the user's environment.
    - Implement the Solution or Escalate as Necessary:
      - Apply the chosen solution remotely using ConnectWise.
      - If the initial solution doesn't work or requires additional resources, escalate the issue following established procedures.
    - Verify Full System Functionality and Implement Preventive Measures:
      - Confirm with the end user that the problem has been resolved.
      - Implement preventive measures remotely to avoid similar issues in the future.
      - Document the solution and any preventive measures taken within ConnectWise.

### Expected Results: 
  Troubleshooting Methodology: The troubleshooting approach will follow the systematic CompTIA Troubleshooting Theory, ensuring a thorough and effective resolution of remote support issues.

By incorporating the CompTIA Troubleshooting Theory into the ConnectWise-based remote support methodology, your team can benefit from a structured and proven approach to problem-solving in IT support engagements.
